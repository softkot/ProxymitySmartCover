# Proxymity Smart Cover

Simple android application to involve android's proximity sensor for non smart flip covers to act as smart ones.

When application installed run it once to silently activate proxymity smart case mode and uninstall application if you do not need this behavior any more.  

P.S. Thus the code based on PROXIMITY_SCREEN_OFF_WAKE_LOCK, application is able to run on API level 21 (Lollipop) and higher
